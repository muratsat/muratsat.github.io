### What is .Net Framework?
.Net Framework is a software development platform developed by Microsoft for building and running Windows applications. The .Net framework consists of developer tools, programming languages, and libraries to build desktop and web applications. It is also used to build websites, web services, and games.

### Program compilation, MSIL, JIT, DLL files, how c# is cross-platform
In C# programs are not compiled directly into executable files, they are compiled to **MSIL**(microsoft intermediate language), when you build a project. Then, when you run a program, **JIT**(just in time) compiler turns it to machine code, which can be executed by processor

**DLL**(Dynamic link library) contains code that can be used by more than one program at a time. They are execuatable files but unlike .exe files, they need to be referenced and cannot be executed directly

Intermediate language is executed by common language runtime, which is specific for each platform. This is why C# is cross-platform
